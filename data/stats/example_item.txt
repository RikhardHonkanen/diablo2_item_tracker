One way to get stats would be to implement one file per item here with a predefined key, like:

MIN_DMG MAX_DMG DURABILITY WHATEVER_STAT

This file would contain comma separated values only (120, 190, 400, 69, etc.)


Probably too many files though, so one file for Armor, Weapon, Jewelry instead more likely. 
Would need ID:s in master data, probably a good idea anyway.
Find some data online.
